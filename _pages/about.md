Hi, my name is Yizheng Wang. I will be a Ph.D. student in Department of Engineering Mechanics, Tsinghua University (2024), supervised by [Prof. Yinghua Liu](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1152/1778.htm) and [Prof. Rabczuk](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3CBuGosAAAAJ&hl=en). I majored in engineering mechanics, mainly doing computational solid mechanics and received my master’s degree supervised by [Prof. Yinghua Liu](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1152/1778.htm) (2019-2022) from the Institute of Solid Mechanics (ISM), Department of Engineering Mechanics, Tsinghua University, and Bachelor's degree from Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjing. I also worked as a research assistant at [Microsoft Research AI4Science](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/) (2022-2023). I will come to Bauhaus University as a guest researcher in Weimar supervised by [Prof. Rabczuk](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3CBuGosAAAAJ&hl=en) for AI for mechanics (2023-2024).

I am majoring in solid mechanics and has rich experience in physical theory, computation, and experiment.  His research is about computational solid mechanics. I mainly focus on solving Partial Differential Equations of solid mechanics based on the physics-informed neural networks(PINNs), operator learning and deep energy method. My research interest is AI4Science, specifically AI for mechanics.
